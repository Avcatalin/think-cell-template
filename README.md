# 4. IMAGE AND ICON FORMATS

# Icons

Format: SVG

Reason: SVG was chosen for icons because it is a lightweight, scalable vector format that ensures high-quality rendering at any resolution. This makes it ideal for responsive designs and future-proofing against screen size variations.
Hero Section Images

Format: 2x Exported PNG

Reason: For the hero section, 2x resolution PNGs were used to ensure crisp and detailed visuals on high-resolution (Retina) screens. PNG format was selected for its ability to maintain image quality, especially for complex designs and graphics.

# 5. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

- HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.
- Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the project. Configured to include custom classes and extended styles.
- Custom JavaScript: Adds small interactive features.

# 6. CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS

The Tailwind CSS configuration (tailwind.config.js) includes the following customizations:

# Custom Colors: Added shades like:

- green-850 (#378F53)
- neutral-150 (#f8f8f8)
- slate-1000 (#231F20)

NOTE: These colors are not part of the default Tailwind color palette and were registered using Tailwind's format.

# Font Family:

The Jost font was used as a substitute for Futura PT, which is not a free font. Jost was chosen because it is part of the same font family and resembles Futura PT.

# Container Centering:

- Configured the container to be centered, with a fixed width of 1264px for extra-large (xl) and 2xl screens.

# Custom Utilities:

Extended utilities for:

- Letter spacing
- Background size

These were tailored for specific uses based on the Figma design.
